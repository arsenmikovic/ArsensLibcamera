controls:
  - StatsOutputEnable:
      type: bool
      description: |
        Toggles the Raspberry Pi IPA to output a binary dump of the hardware
        generated statistics through the Request metadata in the Bcm2835StatsOutput
        control.

        \sa Bcm2835StatsOutput

  - Bcm2835StatsOutput:
      type: uint8_t
      size: [n]
      description: |
        Span of the BCM2835 ISP generated statistics for the current frame. This
        is sent in the Request metadata if the StatsOutputEnable is set to true.
        The statistics struct definition can be found in include/linux/bcm2835-isp.h.

        \sa StatsOutputEnable

  - PispStatsOutput:
      type: uint8_t
      size: [n]
      description: |
        Span of the PiSP Frontend ISP generated statistics for the current
        frame. This is sent in the Request metadata if the StatsOutputEnable is
        set to true. The statistics struct definition can be found in
        https://github.com/raspberrypi/libpisp/blob/main/src/libpisp/frontend/pisp_statistics.h

        \sa StatsOutputEnable

        is the sync ready?

  - SyncFrameWallClock:
      type: int64_t
      description: |
        Wall clock time (in micro seconds)

  - SyncLag:
      type: int64_t
      description: |
        Difference between expected sync time, and real sync time (in micro seconds)

  - SyncMode:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
